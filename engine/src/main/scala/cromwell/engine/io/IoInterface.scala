  * Defines the set of IO methods needed by the WdlStandardLibrary to execute IO engine functions (read_*, write_*, glob, ...).
  * Implementation is Backend specific. Authentication might be workflow specific.
  * An instance of this is expected to be created when a WorkflowDescriptor is instantiated.
  * It will then hold a reference to an IOInterface that can be used throughout the workflow execution to evaluate expressions with IO engine functions.
